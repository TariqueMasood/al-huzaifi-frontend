                The <strong>Fazilat in Hadith and Its Sciences</strong> is
                designed to provide students with an in-depth understanding of
                the sciences of Hadith (Prophetic traditions). This program
                equips students with the necessary skills to analyze, verify,
                and classify Hadith, critically engage with its historical and
                contemporary relevance, and contribute meaningfully to the field
                of Hadith studies. By focusing on classical methodologies and
                modern challenges, the program prepares students for advanced
                academic and practical roles in Islamic studies, research, and
                teaching. The curriculum also emphasizes the importance of
                original research, guiding students to produce scholarly works
                that reflect a deep understanding of Hadith and its sciences.

                    Science of Hadith Terminology (علم مصطلح الحديث):
                  </strong>
                  <br />
                  This module introduces students to the fundamental principles
                  of Hadith classification and terminology. Students will
                  explore the different categories of Hadith (Sahih, Hasan,
                  Da'if, and others) and learn the key methods used by classical
                  scholars to classify narrations. The module also delves into
                  the significance of Isnad (chains of narration) and how these
                  are used to authenticate Hadith.

                  examines how these scholars compiled, organized, and verified
                  Hadith, with a focus on understanding their respective
                  methodologies for ensuring the authenticity and reliability of

                  This course covers the techniques of tracing and verifying
                  Hadith using classical sources. Students will learn how to
                  locate Hadith in original collections, assess the authenticity
                  of various narrations, and accurately reference them in

                  <br />A focused study on the Isnad (chains of narration) of
                  Hadith, this module trains students in the analytical
                  techniques used to evaluate the strength and reliability of
                  chains. The course includes practical exercises in examining
