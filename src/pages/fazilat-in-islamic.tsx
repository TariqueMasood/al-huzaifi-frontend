                equip students with a comprehensive understanding of Islamic
                legal theory and practice. This program provides students with
                both historical and contemporary perspectives on Islamic law,
                focusing on the principles and methodologies that govern the
                development of Islamic legal rulings. Through the study of

                scholarly research, legal reasoning, and the application of
                Islamic law in modern contexts. The curriculum also fosters the

                for producing original contributions to the field of Islamic
                jurisprudence.
