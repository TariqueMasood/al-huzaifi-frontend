          The Arabic Rhetoric (Balaghat) Course offers a comprehensive study of
          Arabic rhetoric, structured around the three main branches of
          Balaghat: Semantics (Ma'an), Clarity (Bayan), and Embellishment
          (Badi'). The curriculum covers the following topics:
        </p>
        <h5>1. Introduction to Arabic Rhetoric (Balaghat): </h5>
        <p>
          Arabic Rhetoric (Balaghat), is the art of effective expression in
          Arabic. It focuses on using language beautifully and persuasively to
          convey deep meanings. In this course, students will learn how to make
          their speech and writing more impactful, following the traditional
          principles of rhetoric (Balaghat).
        </p>
        <h5>2. The Science of Semantics (Ma'ani): </h5>
        <p>
          The science of Semantics (Ma'ani) deals with the meanings behind words
          and sentences. Students will explore how word choices and sentence
          structures can change the meaning of a statement, helping them
          understand how to express thoughts clearly and accurately in different
          contexts.
        </p>
        <h5>3. The Science of Clarity (Bayan): </h5>
        <p>
          Bayan focuses on making speech clear and easy to understand. Students
          will learn how to express ideas in simple, straightforward ways and
          how to use metaphors, similes, and other figures of speech to make
          their language more vivid and expressive.
        </p>
        <h5>4. The Science of Embellishment (Badi'): </h5>
        <p>
          Badi' is the study of beautifying language through the use of
          rhetorical devices, such as alliteration, rhyme, and wordplay. In this
          part of the course, students will learn how to make their speech more
          elegant and artistic, using these techniques to enhance both written
          and spoken Arabic.
        </p>
        <h5>5. Rhetoric (Balaghat) in the Quran and Classical Texts: </h5>
