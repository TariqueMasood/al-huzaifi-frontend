                - This traditional method follows the Darse Nizami curriculum,
                which has been the cornerstone of Islamic education in South
                Asia for centuries. It includes in-depth studies of classical
                Islamic texts, covering subjects such as Tafseer (Quranic
                exegesis), Hadith (Prophetic traditions), Fiqh (Islamic
                jurisprudence), Usul al-Fiqh (principles of jurisprudence),
                Arabic grammar, and logic. The Darse Nizami curriculum is
                renowned for its thoroughness and emphasis on traditional
                scholarship, preparing students to become esteemed Ulama with a
                profound understanding of Islamic sciences.

                - This contemporary approach integrates modern educational
                methodologies with traditional Islamic studies and is structured
                similarly to a university's undergraduate program. It is
                designed to cater to students who prefer a structured and
                systematic academic framework, similar to university education.
                This method includes coursework, research, and assessments, and
                covers a wide range of subjects, including Quranic studies,
                Hadith, Fiqh, Islamic history, and contemporary issues in Islam.
                The modern curriculum ensures that students receive a
                well-rounded education that equips them with both classical
                knowledge and the skills necessary to address contemporary
                challenges.

                well-versed in Islamic knowledge but also capable of addressing
