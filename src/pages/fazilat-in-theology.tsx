              <p>
                The <strong>Fazilat in Theology (Aqeedah)</strong> aims to
                provide students with a deep and comprehensive understanding of
                Islamic theological concepts and philosophical thought. This
                program explores the core tenets of Islamic belief, the
                development of theological discourse, and contemporary
                challenges to Islamic theology. Students will engage with both
                classical and modern texts, learning how Islamic theology has
                evolved and how it responds to modern intellectual and
                ideological movements. The program prepares students to
                contribute to scholarly research and provide informed responses
                to contemporary theological challenges.
